Don't reinvent the wheel, use our extensive set of SDKs!

## What is an SDK?

SDK stands for "Software Development Kit", which is a great way to think about it — a kit. Think about putting together a model car or plane. When constructing this model, a whole bunch of items is needed, including the kit pieces themselves, the tools needed to put them together, assembly instructions, and so forth.

An SDK functions in much the same way, providing a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes and guides that allow developers to create software applications on a specific platform. If an API is a set of building blocks that allow for creating something, an SDK is a full-fledged workshop, facilitating creation far outside the scopes of what an API would allow.

We provide SDKs for plethora of programming languages, ⬅️ look at the left side bar to learn more about each one.
