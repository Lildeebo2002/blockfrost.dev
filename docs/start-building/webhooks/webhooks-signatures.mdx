Blockfrost signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a signature in each event’s `Blockfrost-Signature` header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Blockfrost, not by a third party. You can verify signatures either using our official SDKs, or manually using your own solution.

Before you can verify signatures, you need to retrieve your webhook's authentication token from your Dashboard’s Webhooks settings.

## Using SDK

The fastest way to verify the webhook signature is to use built-in helper function from Blockfrost SDK.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript (Node.js)">

```typescript
import { verifyWebhookSignature, SignatureVerificationError } from "@blockfrost/blockfrost-js";

// You will find your webhook's secret auth token in your webhook settings in the Blockfrost Dashboard
const authToken = 'WEBHOOK-AUTH-TOKEN';
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (request, response) => {
  try {
    const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(
      JSON.stringify(request.body), // stringified request.body
      request.headers["blockfrost-signature"],
      authToken,
      600 // optional param to customize maximum allowed age of the webhook event, defaults to 600s
    );
    if (!isValid) {
      console.log("Signature is not valid!");
    } else {
      // Valid signature, process the event
    }
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof SignatureVerificationError) {
      // If parsing of Blockfrost-Signature header fails it will throw SignatureVerificationError
      console.log(`SignatureVerificationError: ${err.message}`);
    } else {
      // Other errors
      console.error(err);
    }
  }
}

app.listen(6666, () => console.log('Running on port 6666'));
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verifying the signature manually

`Blockfrost-Signature` header contains an unix timestamp with the time of firing the request (prefixed by `t=`) and a signature (prefixed by schema version, currently `v1=`).

Signature itself (part after `v1=`) is created by concatenating:

- The unix timestamp (as a string)
- The character `.`
- The request's JSON payload

Then HMAC with the SHA256 hash function is computed. The concatenated string is used as a message.

`Blockfrost-Signature` header example:

```
t=1648550558,v1=162381a59040c97d9b323cdfec02facdfce0968490ec1732f5d938334c1eed4e
```

Although it’s recommended to use our SDKs to verify webhook event signatures, you can create a custom solution by following these steps.

### 1. Parse the timestamp and signature from the header

Split the header, using the , character as the separator, to get a list of elements. Then split each element, using the = character as the separator, to get a prefix and value pair.

The value for the prefix t corresponds to the timestamp, and v1 corresponds to the signature. You can discard all other elements.

### 2. Prepare the `signature_payload`

Prepare the `signature_payload` by concatenating:

- The unix timestamp (as a string)
- The character `.`
- The request's JSON payload

### 3. Compute the expected signature

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the webhook's authentication token as the key, and use the `signature_payload` string as the message.

### 4. Compare the signatures

Compare the signature from the `Blockfrost-Signature` header to the expected signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.
